To make an existing file in your Git local repository "assume unchanged," you can use the `git update-index` command. This tells Git to ignore changes to the file in your working directory unless you explicitly undo this setting.

### Command:
```bash
git update-index --assume-unchanged <file-path>
```

### Example:
If you want to mark a file named `config.txt` as assume unchanged:
```bash
git update-index --assume-unchanged config.txt
```

### Verifying the Status:
To check whether a file is marked as assume unchanged:
```bash
git ls-files -v | grep ^h
```
Files marked as "assume unchanged" will have an `h` indicator in the output.

### Revert "Assume Unchanged":
If you want to undo this and make Git track changes to the file again:
```bash
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged <file-path>
```

### Notes:
- This does not remove the file from the repository; it just stops Git from noticing changes to it.
- Be cautious with this command in collaborative environments, as changes to the file will not be detected in future commits.
